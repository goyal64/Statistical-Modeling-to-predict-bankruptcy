This project was executed in four phases:
1. Data Exploration: 
a. Stratification
b. Correlation Matrix
c. As the data set was highly 
imbalanced, SMOTE Oversampling was used to balance
the dataset.

2. Training the model:
a. Random Forest
b. Gradient Boost
c. XG Boost
d. Light Gradient Boost

3. Hyperparameter tuning:
a. RandomSearch CV
b. GridSearch CV

4. Final Model Selection:
Light Gradient Boost with an AUC Score of 0.946
